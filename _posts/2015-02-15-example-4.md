    Overfitting in Mathematical Functions​

        Adding more variables to a function​

    Overfitting Linear Functions​

        Regression Models​
        
            The blue line represents an overfitted model and the black line represents a regularized model. ​

            Noisy (roughly linear) data is fitted to both linear and polynomial functions.​
